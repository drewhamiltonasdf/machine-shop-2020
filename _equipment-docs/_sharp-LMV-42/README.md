### The Basics: Acceptable Materials & Safety

  - This is the nicest milling machine you will likely ever encounter. Please treat it with reverence.

  - Up to a point, you can cut almost anything on a milling machine. If your cutting tool is harder than your material, you should be able to cut through it.
    That said, it is advisable to start with softer/easier materials like Delrin, work your way up to aluminum, venture into mild steel, and maybe stainless
    or tool steel with some practice and research into proper speeds and feeds. Milling machines were designed to cut difficult materials. This mill has a
    rigid cast iron construction and 3HP spindle motor. 
  
  - "Speeds & Feeds" are the most important thing to focus on if you are having trouble with difficult materials. Slower speeds and lower feeds are really not
    necessarily going to help you. The CORRECT speeds and feeds are what are going to help you. 

  - Mills are significantly safer than drill presses because the work is held rigidly in a vise. That said, cutting tools are sharp and should be handled with care, and the chips
    produced by them can be very sharp as well, and often quite hot. 
    
        - ALWAYS WEAR EYE PROTECTION! This is 100% non-optional when using machine tools, and not just something that you say in a readme, you really 
          need to do this, or you will end up with corneal abrasions and visits to the ER.
          
        - ALWAYS KEEP LONG HAIR CONTAINED OR IN A BUN! There are countless gory videos on the internet of people using lathes and mills with long hair.
          This is very serious. The powerfeeds, the spindle, anything that moves automatically on lathes and mills can catch hair and loose clothing.

### The Basics: Speeds & Feeds

  - "Speed" refers to the spindle RPM.
  - "Feed" refers to the rate at which the cutting tool feeds into the workpiece.
  - Speed is more material-specific, whereas feed has to do mostly with how much force is being put on the work-piece and the machine.
  - D.O.C. ("Depth of cut") refers to the axial depth of the cutting tool in the material.
  - W.O.C. ("Width of cut") refers to % of the cutter diameter that is engaged with the material.
  - A good rule of thumb for width of cut is 1/3 cutter diameter (and almost always less than 1/2 cutter diameter)
  - MRR, or material removal rate is WOC x DOC x Feedrate (Example 0.10" x 0.2" x 10 inches per minute = 0.2 cubic inches per minute). When playing with the different variables,
    keep MRR in mind. You'll find reasonable rates of removal for different materials and try stick with a range once you get it right.

  - This ![retired machinist](http://tomstechniques.com/) put together an excellent chart for calculating the appropriate spindle speeds for different materials. This is a great starting
  point:

  The spindle speed is the most important thing to get right, but notice that it is not possible to achieve all of the higher speeds recommended for machining with carbide. In
  the chart, you can see he recommends multiplying these values by FOUR for carbide. That would, for example, put the speed at 16,000 RPM for machining aluminum with an 1/8" 
  end mill. In such a case, use the highest speed available without straining the spindle, and keep your feeds moderate. Remember that the higher the spindle speed, the more
  times your end mill's cutting edges will engage with the part as you are feeding through it.
