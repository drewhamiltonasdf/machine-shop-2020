### The Basics: Acceptable Materials & Safety

  - This is the nicest milling machine you will likely ever encounter. Please treat it with reverence.

  - Up to a point, you can cut almost anything on a milling machine. If your cutting tool is harder than your material, you should be able to cut through it.
    That said, it is advisable to start with softer/easier materials like Delrin, work your way up to aluminum, venture into mild steel, and maybe stainless
    or tool steel with some practice and research into proper speeds and feeds. Milling machines were designed to cut difficult materials. This mill has a
    rigid cast iron construction and 3HP spindle motor. 
  
  - "Speeds & Feeds" are the most important thing to focus on if you are having trouble with difficult materials. Slower speeds and lower feeds are really not
    necessarily going to help you. The CORRECT speeds and feeds are what are going to help you. 

  - Mills are significantly safer than drill presses because the work is held rigidly in a vise. That said, cutting tools are sharp and should be handled with care, and the chips
    produced by them can be very sharp as well, and often quite hot. 
    
        - ALWAYS WEAR EYE PROTECTION!This is 100% non-optional when using machine tools, and not 
          just something that you say in a readme, you really need to do this, or you will end up
          with corneal abrasions and visits to the ER.
          
        - ALWAYS KEEP LONG HAIR CONTAINED OR IN A BUN! There are countless gory videos on the 
          internet of people using lathes and mills with long hair. This is very serious. The 
          powerfeeds, the spindle, anything that moves automatically on lathes and mills can catch 
          hair and loose clothing.
          
        - BE AWARE: There are lots of moving parts on a mill. Be aware please.

        - DON'T BE RUSHED: Take your time or regret it later in the quality of your parts.

        - WEAR GLOVES if possible when handling cutting tools, but <b>DO NOT WEAR GLOVES</b> when near rotating tools. They can catch and get wrapped in the tool. Similarly, ensure that
          shirt cuffs etc are held far away from rotating tools.
          
        - DEBURR your parts before handling. Freshly machined metal surfaces leave behind razor-sharp burrs that can and will cut your hands.

        - AVOID CLIMB MILLING for everything but finishing passes. Conventional milling is preferred (feeding WITH the direction of the spindle). More on this later.

### The Basics: Machine Shop Courtesy

  - Assume every doohickey and whatsit is a very important ultra-precision, expensive, instrument.
  - Familiarize yourself with the doohickeys.
  - Machining can be a very messy, dirty business
  - It is a point of pride for machinists to mantain a clean shop in spite of the above fact
  - Always make sure anything that is supposed to be precisely aligned is left either clearly labelled or precisely aligned. Nothing will drive you more insane
    than finding the vise or the spindle axi out of square by 3 degrees because Chad was to eager to go home on Friday night.
  - The tools associated with the mill are sacred objects and should be treated with religious reverence. They should be clean, rust free and stored with care.
  - The tools associated with measuring / set-up are precise beyond your ability to utilize and they need to stay that way.
  - Know to distinguish <b>CLIMB vs. CONVENTIONAL milling</b>.
  - <b>Spindle Oil</b> should be administered every single time you use the milling machine. Way oil is automated, by not the spindle.

&nbsp;

##### The Work Table: Positioning
  The table of the machine moves left and right in the X-axis and front to back in the Y-axis. Both of these axes have linear encoders on them which can show you the relative position of your work to an obscene degree of precision. The Z-axis is always the axis of the spindle with machine tools. This also has an encoder, but it is only attached the "quill", meaning that it will not track adjustments to the "knee" of the machine (though these two adjustments both change the relative z-axis position between your workpiece and your cutting tool).
  All three axes are equipped with hand-feed crank handles as well as motorized "powerfeeds". The X-axis powerfeed is the one most typically used, as it spans a larger distance, but both the Y and Z axis powerfeeds are very useful for moving around in relation to your part without tiring yourself out. Please be aware of possible collisions anytime you use the powerfeeds.

##### The Work Table: Locks
 All three axes of motion with respect to the table occur on dovetailed cast iron slides. Each axis has between 1 and 2 locks. There is a "saddle lock" to lock the Y-axis travel. There is a "work table lock" to lock the X-axis travel. And there is a "Knee Lock Lever" to lock the Z-axis. Please ensure that the locks are in the off-position before engaging
 the powerfeed to prevent stress to the servo motors. However, it is important to use the locks on the stationary machining axes before the cutting tool engages to minimize play
 in the other axes. This is good for ensuring the precision of your parts, but it also prevents the machine from "grabbing" and pulling the table in an unconstrained direction.
 
##### The Collet Closer
 Tools are held in the machine with R8 Collets. This style of collet is what most light-duty manual milling machines in the U.S. used in the past. 
 &nbsp;
  ![alt text](https://github.com/drewhamiltonasdf/machine-shop-2020/blob/main/_equipment-docs/_sharp-LMV-42/_manuals-info-etc/R8-collets.jpg?raw=true)
  &nbsp;
 A collet clamps the tool so it does not move axially while machining by matching the diameter of the cutting tool very closely and then pulling the tapered portion of the collet up into a matching taper inside the machine. When there is no collet in the spindle, you can reach inside it with your finger and feel a small guide pin. The collet itself has a channel that matches this pin. This prevents the collet from rotating when it is being pulled up into the spindle. Check this if you can't get the collet into the spindle. Once the collet is loosely seated in the spindle, a drawbar will engage the threads at the back of the collet pulling it up tight against the mating taper.
 With an automatic collet closer, you do not have to manually turn the drawbar, you can simply press the appropriate button on the closer and the rotation will be accomplished with compressed air automatically to the correct torque. This is very convenient and time-saving but also prevents over and under-tightening of the drawbar.
 When using the collet closer, please observe the procedure written on the closer itself:
   * The quill must be fully retracted and locked.
   * The spindle should be in LOW to prevent rotation.
   * Fingers should be clear of the cutting edges of the tool.

### The Basics: CLIMB MILLING vs CONVENTIONAL MILLING
 
 &nbsp;
 #### Please pay attention to this section. Climb milling when you don't know what you are doing can cause serious bodily harm and damage to the machine and workpiece.
 &nbsp;
 Climb milling should only be used for very light finishing passes on a manual machine. On older machines, it may not even be advisable for light cuts. If you do use climb milling please be aware and start with very light cuts on the order of 0.002" to 0.005". At a minimum please get familiar with the difference between the two types of cutting so you can quickly identify whether you are in a position for conventional or climb milling. If you aren't used to identifying these two types of cuts, the difference can seem subtle, but the results can be dramatic.
 The important concept is this:
  * When climb-milling, the cutter wants to pull the work further into the cutter.
  * If the work is pulled into the cutter the table, in turn, will be pulled toward the cutter. If the table is pulled 
    in this direction, it takes up the slack or backlash of the table and can JUMP forward causing any of the following:
      * Projectile workpiece
      * Breakage/damage of the tool
      * Damage to the table/leadscrew

Here is a handy visual explainer of the difference:
  ![alt text](https://github.com/drewhamiltonasdf/machine-shop-2020/blob/main/_equipment-docs/_sharp-LMV-42/_manuals-info-etc/climb-conventional.JPG?raw=true)
  
 Another way to think of this, which makes planning a cut much easier, is to do you machining in a <b>COUNTER-CLOCKWISE</b> fashion around your part. The following image, hand-crafted by yours truly, shows what I mean:

![alt text](https://github.com/drewhamiltonasdf/machine-shop-2020/blob/main/_equipment-docs/_sharp-LMV-42/_manuals-info-etc/climb-milling.JPG?raw=true) 

The direction of the spindle will always be clockwise looking down onto the workpiece unless you are doing something really bonkers with a left-hand tool.

 &nbsp;
 &nbsp;


### The Basics: Speeds & Feeds

  - "Speed" refers to the spindle RPM.
  - "Feed" refers to the rate at which the cutting tool feeds into the workpiece.
  - Speed is more material-specific, whereas feed has to do mostly with how much force is being put on the work-piece and the machine.
  - D.O.C. ("Depth of cut") refers to the axial depth of the cutting tool in the material.
  - W.O.C. ("Width of cut") refers to % of the cutter diameter that is engaged with the material.
  - A good rule of thumb for width of cut is 1/3 cutter diameter (and almost always less than 1/2 cutter diameter)
  - MRR, or </b>material removal rate</b> is WOC x DOC x Feedrate (Example 0.10" x 0.2" x 10 inches per minute = 0.2 cubic inches per minute). When playing with the different variables,
    keep MRR in mind. You'll find reasonable rates of removal for different materials and try stick with a range once you get it right.

  - This ![retired machinist](http://tomstechniques.com/) put together an excellent chart for calculating the appropriate spindle speeds for different materials. This is a great starting
  point:
  
  ![alt text](https://github.com/drewhamiltonasdf/machine-shop-2020/blob/main/_equipment-docs/_sharp-LMV-42/_manuals-info-etc/feeds-and-speeds.JPG?raw=true)   

  The spindle speed is the most important thing to get right, but notice that it is not possible to achieve all of the higher speeds recommended for machining with carbide. In
  the chart, you can see he recommends multiplying these values by FOUR for carbide. That would, for example, put the speed at 16,000 RPM for machining aluminum with an 1/8" 
  end mill. In such a case, use the highest speed available without straining the spindle, and keep your feeds moderate. Remember that the higher the spindle speed, the more
  times your end mill's cutting edges will engage with the part as you are feeding through it.
  
  &nbsp;

### Lubrication

 - The Spindle should be oiled with every use of the machine to keep it in the immaculate condition that it is currently in. Use <b>Mobil Velocite No. 10</b>, the recommended light duty 
   spindle oil for milling machines, and nothing else! When it comes to Spindle Oil, oils are NOT interchangeable.
 
 - Way oil: (<b>Vactra No. 2</b>) is for the ways only. This can be added to the automatic way oiler when running low.
 
 - Cutting oil. When cutting aluminum and other metals some cutting oil can be used to keep things cool and lubricious. I use "Tap-Magic Aluminum" cutting fluid or "A9" cutting fluid 
   for aluminum, and some mixture of this with heavy cutting oil or tapping fluid for steels (and for tapping, of course).
